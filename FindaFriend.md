# Final Project: Find a Friend!

Looking for a friend to stick with you through thick and thin? Pets are dependable companions that can offer a sense of understanding and empathy. Research has shown that people with pets have lower blood pressure and a better mental health state. A pet can help lower stress levels, depression and anxiety. Owning a pet can encourage you to get outside and stay active. You can feel good about adopting a pet, because you will be giving an animal a loving home.

Adopt a furry friend today, and gain a loving companion for years to come!
