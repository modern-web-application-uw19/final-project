# Project plan

Week 1: I've already started some of the coding just to make sure this was a feasible project. Many of the components are at least started and tested.

Week 2: Set up & test both microservice app and Firebase (for saving of data and user login). Write the remainder of the React code for the components. 

Week 3: Styling of components, user testing, adjusting from feedback and fine tuning, documentation. Launch.
