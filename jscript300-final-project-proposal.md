MTB Suspension Maintenance Tracker

## Elevator Pitch

Modern mountain bikes have suspension that needs to be serviced at regular intervals. Often, these intervals are based off of hours of riding. Currently, most riders are estimating these intervals instead of closely tracking the hours. No regularly servicing suspension can lead to a degradation in performance and possibly damage to parts.  The process of tracking this is complicated by the fact that many modern bikes are full suspension and the intervals for servicing a shock and a fork may not be the same. For example a fork may require a lower leg service every 50 hours and a complete rebuild every 200 hours while the read shock might require a full rebuild every 100 hours. And for riders who own multiple bikes, this process can be even more complicated since different manufactures and different kinds of suspension require different kinds of service.

This app will allow someone to enter their bikes into the app, the kinds of suspension, required service intervals and hours/miles ridden to track when various maintenance needs to be performed.
